# The alpha cluster model is a simple model to describe the alpha cluster structure of oxygen.
# It describes each oxygen nucleus as a cluster of 4 alpha particles in a tetrahedral configuration with a fixed distance between the alpha particles.
# It contains a random orientation of the tetrahedron in space.
# Each alpha particle is described by a Summed Gaussian distribution from de Vries

# The plan:
# * Generate random orientation of the tetrahedron (two angles)
# * Get the vector pointing to the origin of each alpha-particle, by rotating the vector of proper length by the two angles
# * Add a gaussian smearing to the positions in the end
# * Plot a nice 3D projection of the alpha-nucleus

# * Make a 2D projection of the centers of the alpha-particles
# * Generate the positions of the nucleons in the 4 different alpha particles from the Woods-Saxon distribution
# * Add them with the vectors pointing to the origin of the alpha-particles
# * Reuse the code you have to add the hotspots to the nucleus at those positions

# * Celebrate, because you have done it!


# PARAMETERS:
# The tetrahedron has an arm length of 3.42 fm, I would include a Gaussian fluctuation of sigma=0.1 fm in the arm length
